From the MIT scrum lecture
	Will use log entries instead of meetings
	
	Daily standup: will log what was implemented since last checkin, goals for today's check-in, and challenges to that goal, take items from sprint backlog and turn into task list

	Sprint plan(weekly), take items from product backlog and turn to sprint backlog

	Sprint Review(weekly), take a look at what's been done, adjust product backlog as need be

	Sprint Retrospective(weekly), take a look at working methods, and adjust accordingly.


	Aug 20, 2020 - Have decided to use flask instead of django, don't need all that database admin for a simple app

	Aug 22 -  did not work on Aug 21 because of reinstalling and updating computer OS (BSOD), now running python 3.8 as system standard. Reconfigured virtual environment and switched git hook to github.
	imported geopy for functionality of converting a zip code to range of lats and longs, which should be usable with the dataframes gettable from john hopikins
	biggest stumbling blocks was reconfiguring python interpreter (pycharm was anchored on 3.6) and installing packages no longer on the system.

	Aug 25 returning to flask is troubling, may have second guesses about the framework
	Did make a class that will find entries in the dataframe within the lat and long range returned by the geolocator class
	There are two challenges
		1.) the loop through methodology is slow, I get the sense pandas own dataframe methods are much faster
		2.) so many false negatives, even with zip codes in new york,
it may be better to use zip code information to find a county (or nearest county) and not to use zip codes as the unit of measure

	Aug 28
		using geopy and pygeoip to get a location off of an ip address,
FIPS is outdated, so will next pull state and county info from the geolocator class to use as parameters to fleece out the info from the pandas dataframe
Don't like the extra overhead, but location tracking seems to be a tall order.
